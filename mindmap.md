- Exam 1 Review
  - Stab Match/Greed
    - Stab Match
      - Who Stab?
        - First Stabbers - has advantage can steal from prev peer
        - Back-Stabbers - has disadvantage but always trades up
      - Wut Stab?
        - No one can trade up
        - First stabbers can't because another first stabber beat them
        - Back-stabbers can't because first stabbers like someone more
      - How Stab?
        - First stabbers stab with prefs
        - Back-stabbers drop worse offers, keep better
        - Repeat til all matched
    - Greed
      - Interval Sched
        - n log n for prep sorting
        - myopic (read dumb)
        - it fits its ships, worry about tomorrow tomorrow
        - proof
          - find a smarter way
          - find out its actually trash
          - go back to the dumb way
      - Interval Part
        - n log n for prep sorting
        - Multi-threaded type stuff
        - Goal min da threads
        - How?
          - will it fit in a thread? yeah? shove it
          - No? congrats we'll make a thread just for you
          - remember the last thing's last thing
          - also keep these threads in a pq like its dijkstra
        - if you have more threads than things you done messed up
        - also this^^^ is the proof somehow
  - More Greed
    - Schedin to Min Late
      - Goal: min the max lateness
      - cool cool, wtf does that mean?
        - Lateness - basically the finish time minus the due time
        - also if this number is negative set it to zero
        - we're not trying to min total lateness just the max per process so we avoid a mecha-karen situation
        - also trying to do the other thing, min total lateness, is np-hard i think, aka don't try to do that unless you're Turing
      - how
        - sort by deadline, guess what that means? that's right n log n
        - Sched jobs end to end
      - proof
        - bet i could swap some of these
        - oh... guess not
    - Opt Off Cachin
      - Goal: min cache miss
      - Offline like the internet?
        - No this means you know the whole sequence ahead of time
      - Farthest-In-Future^TM^ is best algo
        - bellady
        - 1960s
        - maybe you don't need to know this idk
      - How it works
        - when you have a cache miss kick someone out of the cache
        - put the missed item in the cache
      - cool, um who do i kick?
        - we're offline, so you cheat, look at the seq find the Farthest-In-Future^TM^
      - unreduced vs reduced
        - unreduced - doing dumb stuff aka extra work for no reason
        - reduced - see how it works^^^
        - you can prove unreduced can convert to reduced because you can always just stop doing dumb stuff i guess
      - proof
        - oof - lots of steps/cases
        - by induction - that's the domino proof if you forgot
        - you build double caches - at start they're the same
        - at some point i think you take a different action from FF and prove non-FF is trash?
        - the proof never explicitly says that it just talks about reducibility
        - maybe reducibility means your algo is trash
        - idk good luck
    - Short Paths, MST, Clustin
      - Shortest Path: Dijkstra's Algorithm
        - path cost - sum(edge in path)
        - proof by induction
        - can't do negative weights
        - uses pq for unexplored nodes
      - Minimum Spanning Trees
        - connect all the dots as cheaply as possible
      - Cut - only one endpoint
      - Cycle - makes a circle
      - Prim's
        - makes mst
        - start at some root
        - uses pq
        - grow out by choosing cheapest edge
      - Kruskal's
        - makes mst
        - consider edges in asc of cost
        - insert unless cycle
      - Clustering
        - used for cholera outbreak
        - global clustering is np, local is p
        - forms Kruskal's algo
  - Amorted ysis/Splayed Out
    - Amorted ysis
    - Splayed Out
    - Amorted Splay
