  - Stab Match/Greed
    - Stab Match
      - Who Stab?
        - First Stabbers - has advantage can steal from peer
        - Back-Stabbers - has disadvantage but always trades up
      - Wut Stab?
        - No one can trade up
        - First stabbers can't because another first stabber beat them
        - Back-stabbers can't because first stabbers like someone more
      - How Stab?
        - First stabbers stab with prefs
        - Back-stabbers drop worse offers, keep better
        - Process repeats until all matched.
        - Result: stable matching, proposer-optimal, receiver-pessimal.
    - Greed
      - Interval Sched
        - n log n because of pre-process sorting
        - myopic (read dumb)
        - it fits its ships, worry about tomorrow tomorrow
